# I got away on the 2nd assignment with just using built-in python packages.
    # but in the future, is the point to include code that will install
    # non-standard packages so you can run my code in your virtual environment
    # that does not contain non-standard packages without having to 
    # install anything yourself?  How should I communicate the version of 
    # python that I am running etc.?  
    # (anything aside from just notes in the README?)
answer: yes -- in the setup file, you want to specify the dependencies
    such that when others install your package, the user will install dependencies.
    there may also be a way to specify the version of python, but in general
    in this class we'll just use python 2.7 and you don't need to worry about
    your package being used by other versions.
