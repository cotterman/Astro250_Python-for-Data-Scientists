#The "setup.py" script will allow others to install my code in the standard fashion.
    #Running the setup.py will install my package (and modules) into the Python path
#If youâ€™ve written your own package, use distutils2 to create a standard, share-able zipped file:
    #cd ~\my-python-seminar\hw02-pip_git-cotterman
