#Traits uses the wxWidget toolkit by default to create its widget. 
#They can be turned live and displayed by starting a wx application, and its main loop (ie event loop in wx speech).
#Usually it is not necessary to create the wx application yourself, and to start its main loop, 
 #(traits will do all this for you when the .configure_traits() method is called.)
