GUI Lecture notes:

Tkinter is the most obvious choice to building a GUI, but
    it is not without its weaknesses
    #say you're using "tickle-tk"

wxPython might be great, but it requires a lot of non-built-ins
    and can be very difficult to get working

The go-to for building game GUI is pygame

See grid.py for examples of sticky and anchoring

#could be useful for matplotlib in ipython 
#import sys
#sys.stdout.flush()
